Hi there, 

I'm Nico. My focus goes to **action-oriented functional design**, in **aesthetic information presentations**.  

I'm mostly a *web craftsman* my main tools are [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/)... 

I'm also *teaching* and *training* on these topics.

Find out more about me on [bluepundit.eu](https://bluepundit.eu)
